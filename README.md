This project is a RESTful Web API designed to provide functionalities to build many kinds of workout logs. It offers a robust database structure to store all the useful data from workouts. The API is built with flexibility in mind and so most data columns are nullable so that the client can choose which ones to utilize. It can be used to build workout log applications for either strength/hypertrophy training or cardio training, or both.

The API is implemented with Flask, is a micro web framework written in Python. The database is implemented with SQLite utilizing the SQLAlchemy database toolkit for Python.

An example workout log client utilizing is provided. The client is impolemented with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

>start-development-server.bat

or run commands:

>set FLASK_APP=workoutlog
>
>set FLASK_ENV=development
>
>flask run

4. In a web browser, for the API, go to URL: 

>http://localhost:5000/api/

5. In a web browser, for the client, go to URL:
