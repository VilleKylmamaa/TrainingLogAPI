This project will be a web API designed to log workouts and it will include a client that uses the API. The project is for the Programmable Web course in the University of Oulu.

The API will manage a gym workout log from which I can build a client where I can view the previous workout sessions and enter new sessions. It will provide the exercises and the weights calculated from a training max for the next session in my workout program, and data such as progress over time in training max and estimated maximum strength in different exercises. My workout program is somewhat complex and this project should make running and logging it more enjoyable.
